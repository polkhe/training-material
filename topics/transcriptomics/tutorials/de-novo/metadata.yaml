galaxy_tour: "..."
hands_on: "yes"
slides: "no"
questions:
- "What genes are differentially expressed between G1E cells and megakaryocytes?"
- "How can we generate a transcriptome de novo from RNA sequencing data?"

- "Analysis of RNA sequencing data using a reference genome"
- "Reconstruction of transcripts without reference transcriptome (de novo)"
- "Analysis of differentially expressed genes"

key_points:
- "De novo transcriptome reconstruction is the ideal approach for identifing differentially expressed known and novel transcripts."
- "Differential gene expression testing is improved with the use of replicate experiments and deep sequence coverage."
- "Vizualizing data on a genome browser is a great way to display interesting patterns of differential expression."
