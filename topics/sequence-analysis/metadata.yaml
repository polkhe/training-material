    type: "tutorial"
    name: "quality-control"
    zenodo_link: ""
    galaxy_tour: ""
    hands_on: "yes"
    slides: "yes"
    questions:
    - How to control quality of NGS data?
    - What are the quality parameters to check for each dataset?
    - How to improve the quality of a sequence dataset?
    objectives:
    - Manipulate FastQ files
    - Control quality from a FastQ file
    - Use FastQC tool
    - Understand FastQC output
    - Use tools for quality correction
    requirements:
    time_estimation: "1d/3h/6h"
    key_points:
    - Run quality control on every dataset before running any other bioinformatics analysis
    - Take care of the parameters used to improve the sequence quality
    - Re-run FastQC to check the impact of the quality control
